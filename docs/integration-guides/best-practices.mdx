# Integration Recommendations

## Collecting Payments

- Ensure you verify the details of the payment by comparing the amount, currency, transaction reference etc before you give value
- Always implement webhooks when applicable
- Ensure that you are not rate limited when checking the status of a transaction. Read more about our rate limits here

## Making Payments

- Ensure to handle Transfers and Virtual Cards asynchronously via webhooks

## Error Handling

- Ensure to cater for edge cases by only giving value or rendering service on a definite response as defined by the APIs
- Ensure errors are “caught” and general error messages are shown to users in the worst case.

## Validating Webhooks

- We recommend the use of Secret Hash on your dashboard via Settings > Webhhoks in order to verify that the webhook was sent by Good Tenants

## Security Recommendations

### API Management

Verify that your app meets these requirements for managing your API Keys

- API Keys should not be hardcoded in the codebase.
- API calls requiring your Good Tenants Secret Key should never be initiated from a Client (browser/mobile app). It should be done from the backend/server part of the application
- API Keys should be stored in environmental variables or secrets manager.

### Authentication

- Ensure a strong password policy is enforced e.g. minimum of 8 alphanumeric characters, an upper case, a special character
- Input validation is in place during login
- Implement controls against brute-force - account lockouts, second-factor authentication and so on.
- Store database credentials securely using secrets manager preferably.

### Cookie Management

- Ensure all app session cookies have the following attributes set
  - Secure
  - HTTPOnly
- Upon the user logging out, the user’s session must be terminated server-side, and any client-side session tokens should be cleared and not cached on the user’s machine
- Any session tokens must be stored within session cookies and transported only within HTTP cookie headers

### Session Management

- Session timeouts should be configured on the server
- Session duration should be limited to a maximum of 10 hours, after which the user must be required to authenticate again
- Implement an idle session timeout
- Deny concurrent sessions
- Ensure session tokens are generated using a Random Number Generator (RNG) cryptographic provider so it cannot be easily predictable.

### Session Termination

- A clearly accessible button must exist which allows users to log out of the application, which in turn ends the session on the server
- Application sessions must be invalidated at the server-side
  Log out function must effectively destroy all session tokens and render them useless.

### Handling Sensitive Information

- Securely exchange encryption keys - Ensure key exchanges are performed over a secure channel (TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3)
- Limit the use and storage of sensitive data - Ensure sensitive data are not unnecessarily transported and stored. Where possible use abstract identifiers to reduce data exposure risk.
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest

### Error Handling and Accountability

- Ensure to log all privileged changes
- Log all user (customer) and administrative activities
- Log all access to sensitive data
- When encountered with an unhandled exception, display generic messages to the end-user. Do not reveal details about the internal state of your application eg database errors, app server errors etc
- Store logs securely and follow international standards for log retention

### Input and Output Forms

- All input (user and service) must be validated only on the server-side in addition to any client-side validation to permit only the characters required and field length necessary
- All output back should be encoded
- With proper input validation and output encoding, applications should not be susceptible to cross-site scripting, either stored or reflected. This includes all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields and hidden fields
- Create a whitelist of acceptable characters to be used by the application
- Ensure proper validation is done for files that are uploaded
- Use parameterized SQL queries

### Application Server

- Ensure caching has been disabled on all SSL pages and all pages that contain sensitive data by using value no-cache and no-store instead of private in the Cache-Control header
- All OS, web server and app server security patches are up to date at this time, and new patches are applied in a commercially reasonable timeframe after they are made available by the hardware and software vendors
- SSL must be configured to support only TLS version 1.2 or higher.
- HTTPS is enforced on all pages and endpoints of your application
- The app web server must be configured to disable the TRACE and other HTTP methods if not being used

### Vulnerability and Security Assessment

Ensure your application is secured against this non-exhaustive list

- Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Cross-Site Scripting reflected and stored cross-site scripting
- SQL Injection
- XML Injection
