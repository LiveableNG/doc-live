# Errors

When working with our API, you'll encounter four main kinds of errors: authorization errors, validation errors, server errors and Good Tenants errors.
Each type of error comes with an appropriate HTTP status code.

All errors share the same basic response format: a `status` key set to "error", and a `message` describing the error.
There may also be a `data` object containing more details, for example:

```js
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "secret key required",
    "data": null
}
```

### Authorization errors

You'll get authorization errors when you don't provide your secret key to authorize an API call, or when the key provided isn't correct.
They come with a **401 Unauthorized** status code:

```js
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Authorization required",
    "data": null
}
```

### Validation errors

Validation errors are returned when your request fails one or more validation rules.
Examples include not passing required parameters. They come with a **400 Bad Request** status code:

```js
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "purpose is required",
    "data": null
}
```

### Server errors

Server errors occur when something goes wrong on our end.
In such a case, you should retry after a while, or reach out to our support.
They come with a **500 Internal Server Error** status code.

```js
{
  "error_id": "ERRNO796977608T1620310828419",
  "message": "Application error. Please contact support",
  "code": "app_error"
}
```

### Good Tenants errors

Good Tenants errors are typically returned when your request fails some limit / resource access / compliance checks.

They come with a **400 Bad Request** status code. Here's a non-exhaustive list of some common error messages and their causes.
