# Authentication

### Test Mode vs Live Mode

There are two "modes" of operation for your Good Tenants account:

1. **Live Mode:** Real transactions, real effects. Only switch to this after you've tested your integration thoroughly.

2. **Test Mode:** No real transaction is involved. We'll still send email notifications, and most of the API functions the same.

You can easily switch between Live and Test modes with the API keys sent to your mail.
Test keys will always have `\_test` in the prefix (for example, `pk_test_aa06f088645a8f2516887347580721`)

### API keys

When you create a Good Tenants account, you're given three kinds of API keys:

1. **Secret key:** The most powerful type of key. It can authorize any action on your account, so it should never be exposed to the public.
2. **Public key:** The key you'll use in "public" scenarios, such as in front-end JavaScript code (e.g. [Tenant Verification Inline](/docs/guides/tenant-verification-inline) ).

To get your keys:

- A mail will be sent with the title **Welcome to GoodTenants.io - Your API Keys for Seamless Integration**

:::warning Don't take any chances

If you think your keys may have been compromised (for instance, you accidentally committed them to Git), you should immediately reach to [support](/docs/integration-guides/support).

This will invalidate all existing keys and give you a new set, and you can then update your app to use the new ones.

:::

### Authorizing API calls

All API calls on Good Tenants are authenticated. API requests made without authorization will fail with the status code 401: Unauthorized.

:::info Don't take any chances

Your secret key can perform any actions on your Good Tenants account without restriction. It should be kept confidential and only stored on your servers, preferably as an environment variable.

It should not be included in your Git repository or front-end JavaScript code.
