# Quick Start

Welcome! With our APIs, you can verify tenants in dozens of countries. Here's what you need to do:

### Step 1. Create an account

Start your experience by creating a [free Good Tenants account](https://goodtenants.ng/).
By default, your secret keys will be sent to your mail after your business has been approved.

In the test environment, you would be able to:

1. Verify tenants information mocked data.
2. Configure your integration
3. Complete your KYC and go live.

### Step 2. Configure your integration

Choose from our various integration methods to build your integration. Some of our popular options are:

1. [Javascript inline script](/docs/guides/tenant-verification-inline)
2. [Libraries and Plugins](/docs/sdks-and-plugins/frontend-libraries)

:::info In a nutshell

We wrote these docs assuming that you are familiar with APIs and can make API calls.
If you are new to the concept of APIs, You should check out our [Guides](http://localhost:3000/docs/category/guides).

:::

You can test your integrations with our [mock inline example](https://codepen.io/Goodtenants/pen/BaGJyXL).
We also put together a glossary for [error messages](/docs/integration-guides/errors)
and [best practices](/docs/integration-guides/best-practices) to help you build your integration.

### Step 3. Complete your KYC

To take your account live, We'll need to review your details and profile it correctly for the best experience.
You are required to submit your business documents(see full list) and other relevant information to make this review possible.

### Step 4. Go live and start verification from your users

Once your account has been approved, you can start verification from your customers.
Transfer your settings used in the test environment to your live account.
