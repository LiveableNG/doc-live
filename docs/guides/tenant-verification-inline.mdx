# Tenant Verification Inline

Tenant Verification Inline is the easiest way to collect verify tenants on your website:
Import our lightweight JavaScript library on your verification page,
then call the Tenant Verification.setup() function when the customer clicks on your verify button.
We'll handle the verficiation and return to you when it's done.

In this guide, we'll walk you through using Tenant Verification Inline on your site.

## An example

Here's what an implementation of Flutterwave Inline on a checkout page could look like:

<iframe
  src="https://codepen.io/Goodtenants/embed/BaGJyXL?default-tab=html%2Cresult"
  width="100%"
  height="300"
  frameborder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowfullscreen="true"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Good Tenants Inline Verification"
>
  See the Pen{" "}
  <a href="https://codepen.io/Goodtenants/pen/BaGJyXL">
    Good Tenants Inline Verification{" "}
  </a>{" "}
  by Good Tenants (<a href="https://codepen.io/Goodtenants">@Goodtenants</a>) on{" "}
  <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

Let's take a closer look at the key things this code does:

- First, you include the Flutterwave Inline library with a script tag:

  ```html
  <script src="https://js.goodtenants.ng/popup.js"></script>
  ```

- Next up is the verify button.
  This is the button the customer clicks to verify themselves.
  You'll attach an onclick event handler to this button that calls Verification.setup(),
  a custom JS function you're going to write.

  ```html
  <button onclick="beginVerification()">Begin Verification</button>
  ```

- Finally, in the beginVerification() function,
  you call the Verification.setup() function with some custom parameters:

  ```js
  function beginVerification() {
    Verification.setup({
      first_name: "John",
      last_name: "Doe",
      email: "client@goodtenants.ng",
      key: "pk_test_8c2a6db4d530d3b316885498579597",
      onClose: function () {
        console.log("Closed");
      },
      callback: function (data) {
        console.log(data);
      },
    });
  }
  ```

### Calling `Verification.setup()`

Let's take a closer look at the parameters we passed when calling `erification.setup`:

## Callbacks

Alright, so now you've called Verification.setup(). What happens when the verification is done?

### Callback

In this case, you'll specify a JavaScript function that we'll call when the payment is done, passing in the payment object.
Here's what that object looks like:

```js
{
  "amount": 54600,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Rose DeWitt Bukater",
    "email": "rose@unsinkableship.com",
    "phone_number": "08102909304"
  },
  "flw_ref": "FLW-MOCK-597ae423f1470309edcb5879e3774bfa",
  "status": "successful",
  "tx_ref": "titanic-48981487343MDI0NzMx",
  "transaction_id": 495000
}
```
