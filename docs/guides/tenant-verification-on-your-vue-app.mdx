# Tenant Verification on your Vue App

:::tip In a nutshell

Need to start verify tenants through your Vue app? In this article,
we'll be exploring how to connect Tenant verification with your Vue app.
We'll be using a sample tenant popup for our demo.

:::

## Introduction

:::tip Before you begin

You should [register your business with Good Tenants account](https://goodtenants.ng/).
We'll provide you with test keys that you can use to make test your integration.

:::

We're going to use our public keys for this demo.
To get your public key, once your business have been onboard, an email will be sent to registered email,
stating your secret keys.

You'll notice you have two public keys: **Test** and **Live**.
While building your app, it's a good idea to use your test keys, as this will allow you to simulate transactions.
Once your app is production-ready, you can switch over to your live keys.

:::danger Never use secret keys on client-side

Since this is a client-side integration, it means that our API keys will be exposed.
To prevent anyone gaining access to our Good Tenants account,
we want to make sure we're using our public keys.
Secret keys should only ever be used on the server.

### Project Setup

If you’re already familiar with Vue, then this section would be pretty familiar to you and you can skip to the next section, Installing Paystack. If not, VueJS is a Javascript library used for building frontend applications. NPM and Yarn are popular installation methods when building large scale applications with Vue.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it’s installed, navigate to your desired folder and create a new Vue project;

```bash
vue create project_name
```

The terminal would show you a couple of preset configurations, as a beginner, it’s recommended to choose the default.
This would create a sample project `project_name` in the current directory.

## Install Verification Package

Now to add the [Verification package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/verification-package),
this package contains the Paystack Inline JS library and the checkout as a single component.
To add this plugin to your vue project;

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i verification-package --save
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add verification-package
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it's installed, open `HelloWorld.vue` file like this:

```js
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="initVerification">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Verification from "verification-package";

export default {
  methods: {
    initVerification() {
      Verification.setup({
        first_name: "john",
        last_name: "doe",
        email: "johndoe@mail.com",
        purpose: "residential",
        key: "pk_test_8c2a6db4d530d3b316885498579597",
        onClose: () => console.log("close"),
        callback: () => console.log("success"),
      });
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

Now the component is ready for you to use.

### Start project

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm run start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Verification.setup has 7 required props:

| Param      | Required? | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| first_name | no        | Your first name                                                         |
| last_name  | no        | Your last name                                                          |
| email      | yes       | Email used for registeration                                            |
| purpose    | yes       | If verification is for a residential or commercial                      |
| key        | yes       | Remember, public keys for client-side code always                       |
| close      | yes       | A function that will run when the customer closes the Verfication Popup |
| callback   | yes       | A function that will run after a successful Verfication is completed    |

There you have it, our tenant verification integration is now complete.
The full code sample is in this repository and you can check out the live demo.
