# Tenant Verification on your React App

:::tip In a nutshell

Need to start verify tenants through your React app?

In this article,
we'll be exploring how to connect Tenant verification with your React app.
We'll be using a sample tenant popup for our demo.

:::

## Introduction

:::tip Before you begin

You should [register your business with Good Tenants account](https://goodtenants.ng/).
We'll provide you with test keys that you can use to make test your integration.

:::

We're going to use our public keys for this demo.
To get your public key, once your business have been onboard, an email will be sent to registered email,
stating your secret keys.

You'll notice you have two public keys: **Test** and **Live**.
While building your app, it's a good idea to use your test keys, as this will allow you to simulate transactions.
Once your app is production-ready, you can switch over to your live keys.

:::danger Never use secret keys on client-side

Since this is a client-side integration, it means that our API keys will be exposed.
To prevent anyone gaining access to our Good Tenants account,
we want to make sure we're using our public keys.
Secret keys should only ever be used on the server.

### Project Setup

If you’re already familiar with React, then this section would be pretty familiar to you and you can skip to the next section,
Installing Verification package. If not, ReactJS is a Javascript library used for building frontend applications.
NPM and Yarn are popular installation methods when building large scale applications with React.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create-react-app my-app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The terminal would show you a couple of preset configurations, as a beginner,
it’s recommended to choose the default.
This would create a sample project called `my-app` in the current directory.

Once it’s installed, navigate to `my-app` folder;

```bash
cd my-app
```

For the purpose of this guide, I’ll be creating a simple button when clicked will popup verification form.

## Install Verification Package

Now to add the [Verification package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/verification-package),
this package contains the Verfication Inline JS library as a single component.
To add this plugin to your React project;

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i verification-package --save
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add verification-package
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it's installed, import the library into your App.js file like this

```js
import "./App.css";
import Verification from "verification-package";

function initVerification() {
  Verification.setup({
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email: "client@goodtenants.ng",
    purpose: "residential",
    key: "pk_test_....",
    onClose: () => console.log("close"),
    callback: () => console.log("success"),
  });
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>Hello</p>
      {initVerification()}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now the component is ready for you to use.

### Start project

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm run start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Verification.setup has 7 required props:

| Param      | Required? | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| first_name | no        | Your first name                                                         |
| last_name  | no        | Your last name                                                          |
| email      | yes       | Email used for registeration                                            |
| purpose    | yes       | If verification is for a residential or commercial                      |
| key        | yes       | Remember, public keys for client-side code always                       |
| close      | yes       | A function that will run when the customer closes the Verfication Popup |
| callback   | yes       | A function that will run after a successful Verfication is completed    |

There you have it, our tenant verification integration is now complete.
The full code sample is in this repository and you can check out the live demo.
