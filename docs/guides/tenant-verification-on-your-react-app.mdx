# Tenant Verification on your React App

:::tip In a nutshell

Need to start verify tenants through your React app?

In this article,
we'll be exploring how to connect Tenant verification with your React app.
We'll be using a sample tenant popup for our demo.

:::

## Introduction

:::tip Before you begin

You should [register your business with Good Tenants account](https://goodtenants.ng/).
We'll provide you with test keys that you can use to make test your integration.

:::

We're going to use our public keys for this demo.
To get your public key, once your business have been onboard, an email will be sent to registered email,
stating your secret keys.

You'll notice you have two public keys: Test and Live.
While building your app, it's a good idea to use your test keys, as this will allow you to simulate transactions.
Once your app is production-ready, you can switch over to your live keys.

:::danger Never use secret keys on client-side

Since this is a client-side integration, it means that our API keys will be exposed.
To prevent anyone gaining access to our Good Tenants account,
we want to make sure we're using our public keys.
Secret keys should only ever be used on the server.

### Project Setup

If you’re already familiar with React, then this section would be pretty familiar to you and you can skip to the next section, Installing Paystack. If not, ReactJS is a Javascript library used for building frontend applications. NPM and Yarn are popular installation methods when building large scale applications with React.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it’s installed, navigate to your desired folder and create a new React project;

```bash
cd my-app
```

The terminal would show you a couple of preset configurations, as a beginner, it’s recommended to choose the default. This would create a sample project `project_name` in the current directory. For the purpose of this guide, I’ll be creating a simple charity form to collect a user name, email address, and accepts payment from donors.

Here’s my `App.React` snippet:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <section>
      <h1>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet</h1>
      <div class="formcontainer">
        <hr />
        <div class="container">
          <label for="uname">
            <strong>Full Name</strong>
          </label>
          <input
            v-model="full_name"
            required
            type="text"
            placeholder="John Doe"
            name="uname"
          />
          <label for="email">
            <strong>Email Address</strong>
          </label>
          <input
            v-model="email"
            required
            type="text"
            placeholder="customer@email.com"
            name="email"
          />
          <label for="amount">
            <strong>Amount</strong>
          </label>
          <input
            v-model="amount"
            type="tel"
            placeholder="1000"
            name="amount"
            required
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
    <img style="max-width:200px;" alt="React logo" src="./assets/pstk.png" />
  </div>
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {},
    data: () => {
      return {
        amount: 0,
        full_name: "",
        email: "",
      };
    },
  };
</script>
```

## Install Verification Package

Now to add the [Verification package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/verification-package),
this package contains the Paystack Inline JS library and the checkout as a single component.
To add this plugin to your React project;

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i verification-package --save
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add verification-package
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it's installed, import the library into your App.React file like this

```js
<script>
import paystack from 'React-paystack';

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    paystack
  },
  data: () => {
    return {
      amount: null,
      full_name: null,
      email:null
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

Now the component is ready for you to use in the payment form.

## Accept Payments

Now let's add the component to the form. The Paystack component has 5 required props:

**1. amount ** - The amount we're charging the customer
**2. email ** - All transactions on Paystack require a customer's email address
**3. paystackkey ** - Remember, public keys for client-side code always
**4. callback ** - A function that will run after a successful transaction is completed
**5. close ** - A function that will run when the customer closes the Paystack Checkout

```js
<paystack
    :amount="amount * 100"
    :email="email"
    :paystackkey="PUBLIC_KEY"
    :reference="reference"
    :callback="processPayment"
    :close="close"
  >
    Make Payment
 </paystack>
```

:::tip Convert amount to a lower denomination

The amount entered by the customer should be converted to kobo before it's submitted, this is done by simply multiplying the value by 100

:::

The unique reference field is auto generated, and the email and amount fields are collected from the user's input. Here are the callback methods:

```js
. . .

computed: {
   reference() {
      let text = "";
      let possible =
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));

      return text;
    }
  },
  methods: {
    processPayment: () => {
      window.alert("Payment recieved")
    },
    close: () => {
     console.log("You closed checkout page")
    }
  },

. . .
```

There you have it, our payment integration is now complete. The full code sample is in this repository and you can check out the live demo.

We also have another sample sneakers store built in React, here's the repository and live demo.
